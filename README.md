##  About
This project is a backend service that automates the early-stage screening of job applicants. The system receives a candidate’s CV and project report, evaluates them against a provided job description and case study brief, and generates a structured AI-based assessment. Using a lightweight RAG pipeline and an asynchronous queue worker, the service produces consistent evaluation results that include scores, strengths, weaknesses, and a final suitability summary
